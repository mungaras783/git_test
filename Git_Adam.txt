git config --global user.name "mungaras783"
git config --global user.email "official email"

git clone <source-centralrepo> <dest-localrepo> (default location is current dir)
after couple of updates to current working directory run following command
git status
if we notice any untracked files, then run
untracking--->staging--->commit changes
git add . (taking all the files from current working directory)
git status
git commit -m "message", it's best practice to have a UserStory, Ticket# in commit message.
.git folder contains repo folder, snap shots. it's a hidden folder
git log (shows all commits from current working directory/repo)
git log -number ('1' represents latest commit)
git log --oneline (short desciption of commits)
git log --oneline -1
git show <commit-Id> (what differ between previous and current versions)
git never consider empty folders.
git push (pushing the changes from local to central repo)
git clone <source-repo> destination-folder----> this will create another workspace and then we can edit the date. push them to central repo.
git pull (Pulling the changes which were done by team mates/ sync or update repo)
